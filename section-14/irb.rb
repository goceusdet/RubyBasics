# irb = interactive ruby console
# irb console helps us to run parts of code in console
# through irb, we can declare variables and instantiate them and later we can call them 

# IRB CONSOLE EXAMPLE:
=begin
    irb(main):028> {name: "My Name", age: 100, address: "Any Street"}
    => {:name=>"My Name", :age=>100, :address=>"Any Street"}
    irb(main):029> {name: "My Name", age: 100, address: "Any Street"}.class
    => Hash
    irb(main):030> {name: "My Name", age: 100, address: "Any Street"}.class.superclass
    => Object
    irb(main):031> {name: "My Name", age: 100, address: "Any Street"}.class.superclass.superclass
    => BasicObject
    irb(main):032> {name: "My Name", age: 100, address: "Any Street"}.class.superclass.superclass.superclass
    => nil
    irb(main):033>
=end
