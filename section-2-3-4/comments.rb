# comment all line by selecting them first and then Crtl + /

# print "This is 'Print'"
# print " This is 'Print 2' "
# puts 'this is "puts"'
# puts "this is 'puts'"
# puts ''
# p "This is 'P'"



# another way of selecting many rows:

=begin
print "This is 'Print'"
print " This is 'Print 2' "
puts 'this is "puts"'
puts "this is 'puts'"
puts ''
p "This is 'P'"
=end

# this is how we comment one line
